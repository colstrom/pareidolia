#+TITLE: Pareidolia - A Library for Clouding Coherently
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview

=pareidolia= makes aws-sdk seem more consistent than actually it is.

* Why does this exist?

=aws-sdk= is an excellent gem, but there are a lot of places where the
inconsistencies of the API show through. =pareidolia= is a thin layer on top of
this, providing the missing consistency.

* Installation

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    gem install pareidolia
  #+END_SRC

* Enhancements

** Handles Rate Limiting
   
   Rate Limit errors are handled by retrying after a randomized delay of between
   =1.0= and =4.0= seconds.

** Caching

   Responses are cached by default, using simple memoization. Every method
   includes a ~!~ variant that ignores the cache (and updates it with the
   response).

** Straightforward Response Payloads

   Most AWS calls return an envelope of sorts. More confusingly, the
   envelope is not consistently shaped.
   
   - =describe_vpcs= returns a =Struct= with a =vpcs= field.
   - =describe_instances= returns a =Struct= with a =reservations= field, that
     in turn contains an =Array= of =Structs= with an =instances= field.
   - =describe_moving_addresses= returns a =Struct= with a
     =moving_address_statuses= field.
   - =describe_volume_status= returns a =Struct= with a =volume_statuses= field.
   - and so on.

   =pareidolia= returns the *contents* of the envelope, instead.

   - =vpcs= returns an =Array= of =VPC=.
   - =instances= returns an =Array= of =Instance=.
   - =moving_address_statuses= returns an =Array= of =MovingAddressStatus=.
   - =volume_statuses= returns an =Array= of =VolumeStatus=.

** Consistent Method Names

   - =reservations= returns an =Array= of =Reservation=.
   - =moving_address_statuses= is an alias for =moving_addresses=
   - =instance_statuses= is an alias for =instance_status=
